**Project Title**

**Modeling U.S. Macroeconomic Activity Using the FRED-MD Dataset**

**Overview**

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for Milestone One of my Data Science Capstone (DX799 O1). The project applies a series of machine learning and econometric methods to forecast monthly industrial production growth (Δlog(INDPRO) × 100) using the FRED-MD dataset.

The analysis progresses over six weeks of modeling experiments, each introducing new techniques for improving predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness in macroeconomic forecasting.

**Dataset**

The dataset originates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis – FRED-MD Database, a publicly available monthly panel of U.S. macroeconomic indicators developed by McCracken and Ng (2015).
